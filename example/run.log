Step 1: Aligning Zjn_sc00188.1.fa to Zmw_sc00394.1.fa with nucmer!
Total number of genes in Zmw_sc00394.1: 27
Total number of genes in Zjn_sc00188.1: 12

Step 2: Extracting PAVs from nucmer output!
Total number of PAVs extracted from Zjn_sc00188.1: 10

Step 3: Aligning the extracted PAVs against reference genome using blastn!


Building a new DB, current time: 02/17/2019 15:59:14
New DB name:   /public/home/tahir/softwares/ppsPCP/example/tmp/Zmw_sc00394.1_database
New DB title:  Zmw_sc00394.1_DB
Sequence type: Nucleotide
Keep MBits: T
Maximum file size: 1000000000B
Adding sequences from FASTA; added 1 sequences in 0.126485 seconds.

Step 4: Filtering PAVs from blastn output (1. high coverage and similarity, 2. unmapped/ no similarity)!
Number of filtered Zjn_sc00188.1 PAVs having definded covergae/similarity: 7
Number of filtered Zjn_sc00188.1 PAVs having no similarity/hit with Zmw_sc00394.1: 3

Step 5: Extension and correction of filtered PAVs by matching them with query genome to get full gene covering regions!
Total number of Zjn_sc00188.1 PAVs after boundries correction: 10

Step 6: Filtering and annotating genes overlapped with extracted PAVs!

Step 7: Merging filtered information with reference genome and making sequence based draft pan-genome!
Size of the draft pan-genome: 401K
Number of genes overlapped with Zjn_sc00188.1 PAVs and added into draft genome: 12

Step 8: Realigning the draft pan-genome to query genome as reference using BLAT, to filter less similar genes or genes not fulfill the previous defined criteria!
No fasta index found for Zjn_sc00188.1.fa. Rebuilding, please wait..
Fasta index rebuilt.
Loaded 403788 letters in 2 sequences
Searched 8569 bases in 12 sequences

Number of Zjn_sc00188.1 genes mapped to draft pan-genome: 12
Number of Zjn_sc00188.1 genes NOT mapped to draft pan-genome: 0

Step 9: Including missing/less similar genes to step 5 output for final process!

No unmapped gene found, keep processing!

Step 10: Generating final pan-genome and its annotation file!
Number of Zjn_sc00188.1 PAVs added to the pan-genome1: 8
Number of Zjn_sc00188.1 genes added to the pan-genome1: 12
Average length of Zjn_sc00188.1 PAVs: 24.021Kb
Total size of the pan-genome1: 401K
Total number of genes in the pan-genome1: 39
